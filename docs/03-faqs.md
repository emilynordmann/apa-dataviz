# FAQs

Before the webinar, you were given the opportunity to ask questions. Here are responses to the most frequent.

### What are the best resources for learning R as a beginner?

If you're a complete beginner and a psychology, I can recommend our own PsyTeachR collection:
- [Data Skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v3/) is our 1st year undergrad course and is a very slow introduction to working in R, data wrangling, descriptives, and data viz
- [Analysis](https://psyteachr.github.io/analysis-v3/) is our 2nd year UG resource and introduce inferential stats: chi-square, correlation, t-test, ANOVA, and regression
- [Statistical models](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/) is our 3rd year UG resource and goes full GLM and introduces mixed effect models
- [Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v3/) is our one-year conversion course resource which is a compressed version of our 1st and 2nd year coverage.
- [Applied data skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v3/) doesn't go into inferential stats,instead it's a deep dive into producing reproducible reports, data wrangling, transformation, and data viz.

For resources that weren't written by my team:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)


### What are the best resources specifically for data viz?

- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- [Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/)
- [BBC Visual and Data Journalism cookbook for R graphics](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#how_to_create_bbc_style_graphics)
- [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)
- [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)](https://ggplot2-book.org/)

### How can I use AI to help me learn to code

We've written a companion book: [AITutoR](https://psyteachr.github.io/AITutoR/)

### How do you teach undergraduates R?

The above links to our resources show you our materials and they allhave a Creative Commons licence so you can adpat and reuse them. I have also given a talk about our approach more broadly regarding teaching reproducible data skills: [slides here](https://osf.io/24c65).
