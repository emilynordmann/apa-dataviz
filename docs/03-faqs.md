# FAQs

Before the webinar, you were given the opportunity to ask questions. Here are responses to the most frequent.

### Why should I use R for data viz?

I am going to entirely plagiarism from our paper: [Data Visualization Using R for Researchers Who Do Not Use R](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/25152459221074654)

> Data visualization benefits from the same advantages as statistical analysis when writing code rather than using point-and-click software—reproducibility and transparency. The need for psychological researchers to work in reproducible ways has been well documented and discussed in response to the replication crisis (e.g., Munafò et al., 2017), and we will not repeat those arguments here. However, there is an additional benefit to reproducibility that is less frequently acknowledged compared with the loftier goals of improving psychological science: If you write code to produce your plots, you can reuse and adapt that code in the future rather than starting from scratch each time.

> In addition to the benefits of reproducibility, using R for data visualization gives the researcher almost total control over each element of the plot. Although this flexibility can seem daunting at first, the ability to write reusable code recipes (and use recipes created by others) is highly advantageous. The level of customization and the professional outputs available using R has, for instance, led news outlets such as the BBC (BBC Visual and Data Journalism, 2019) and The New York Times (Bertini & Stefaner, 2015) to adopt R as their preferred data-visualization tool."

### What are the best resources for learning R as a beginner?

If you're a complete beginner and a psychology, I can recommend our own PsyTeachR collection:
- [Data Skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/data-skills-v3/) is our 1st year undergrad course and is a very slow introduction to working in R, data wrangling, descriptives, and data viz
- [Analysis](https://psyteachr.github.io/analysis-v3/) is our 2nd year UG resource and introduce inferential stats: chi-square, correlation, t-test, ANOVA, and regression
- [Statistical models](https://psyteachr.github.io/stat-models-v1/) is our 3rd year UG resource and goes full GLM and introduces mixed effect models
- [Fundamentals of Quantitative Analysis](https://psyteachr.github.io/quant-fun-v3/) is our one-year conversion course resource which is a compressed version of our 1st and 2nd year coverage.
- [Applied data skills](https://psyteachr.github.io/ads-v3/) doesn't go into inferential stats,instead it's a deep dive into producing reproducible reports, data wrangling, transformation, and data viz.

For resources that weren't written by my team:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)


### What are the best resources specifically for data viz?

- [Fundamentals of Data Visualization](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/)
- [Data Visualization: A practical introduction](https://socviz.co/)
- [BBC Visual and Data Journalism cookbook for R graphics](https://bbc.github.io/rcookbook/#how_to_create_bbc_style_graphics)
- [The R Graph Gallery](https://r-graph-gallery.com/)
- [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis (3e)](https://ggplot2-book.org/)

### How can I use AI to help me learn to code/

We've written a companion book: [AITutoR](https://psyteachr.github.io/AITutoR/)

### How do you teach undergraduates R?

The above links to our resources show you our materials and they allhave a Creative Commons licence so you can adpat and reuse them. I have also given a talk about our approach more broadly regarding teaching reproducible data skills: [slides here](https://osf.io/24c65).
