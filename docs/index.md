# Intro to Data Viz {-}

## Webinar prep

To get the most out of the webinar, you should have R and RStudio installed so that you can follow along and execute the code on your own device. You don't have to do this and you are welcome to just listen in but you will get more out of the session if you play an active role.

* If you don't currently have R or RStudio installed, we have produced a guide on how to install R and Rstudio [for Windows](https://psyteachr.github.io/RSetGo/installing-r-windows.html) and for [Mac](https://psyteachr.github.io/RSetGo/installing-r-mac.html).
* If you have R and/or RStudio installed, you can follow [this guide to update](https://psyteachr.github.io/RSetGo/updating-r.html) to the latest version before the workshop.
* If you have technical issues and cannot install R and RStudio on your machine (e.g., if you don't have admin rights), you can sign-up for an [RStudio Cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/) account although the interface will be a little different from the desktop version that will be used in the webinar.
* Please note that I will not be able to provide technical assistance during the webinar for installation issues. 

Once you've done one of the above:

* Work through Intro to R and R Studio (section\ \@ref(intro)) which will introduce you to some basic programming terminology and install everything you need to follow along in the workshop. Depending upon your familiarity with R, this should take 1-2 hours.
* Familiarize yourself with the data set we'll be using for this webinar by reading the associated paper [Data from an International Multi-Centre Study of Statistics and Mathematics Anxieties and Related Variables in University Students (the SMARVUS Dataset)](https://openpsychologydata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jopd.80)
* **Download the data files** - <a href="data/webinar_files.zip" download>here is a zip folder of everything you need</a>. Unzip the folder and have a look through the Rmd file - these are the ones we'll use in the webinar.
* Browse through the FAQs for responses to questions submitted in advance of the webinar that includes links to additional training and materials for learning R.


## Statement on AI use

This webinar and online resource was designed by a human (Emily Nordmann) but augmented with the use of ChatGPT4o, the output of which was verified by said human.
